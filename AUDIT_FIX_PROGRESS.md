| [#327](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/327) | never report a genuine record as not found | P0-10 | Verify screen's two-way verdict → seven explicit states in a pure `verifyVerdict.ts`; the red "not found" is asserted only against **live** data (otherwise "Verification Unavailable" / "Could Not Confirm" + Retry); `idle` counts as checking | Freshness provenance behind the stale flag = #328 |
| [#328](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/328) | distinguish live data from a saved copy, and bound every request | PUB-FE-01 | `source: network\|snapshot\|empty`; `savedAt` only from a real network response; SW API rule `NetworkFirst` → `NetworkOnly`; 12 s request / 30 s chat deadlines; concurrent loads share one request | Showing the age prominently in the UI is a design change → W5/W6 |
| [#329](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/329) | one canonical cache key and one method per action | PUB-BE-01, PUB-BE-02 | Cache key = (action, live version) only, so junk params can no longer force a rebuild; body-only caching (CORS never shared); `ACTION_METHODS` → `405` + `Allow`, enforced before any I/O. **First tests for this Worker** (19) + a CI step | Popup time-awareness → PR-20; single-flight → PR-24; lockfile/Miniflare → PR-25 |

<sub>#322 was closed as superseded by #323: GitGuardian flagged an *intermediate* commit (an enumerated list of credential column names), and such findings stay attached to a PR's whole history — the branch was recreated from `main` as one clean commit.</sub>

## 2. This PR — the health probe stops paying for itself in database calls

**Audit ID:** PUB-BE-03. Second W2 PR.

`GET ?health=1` ran **six D1 round-trips and a KV read on every call**, and it sits before the rate limiter on purpose (a monitor must not be able to throttle itself into a false alarm). A monitor polling every 30 s therefore spent ~17,000 D1 round-trips a day answering *"is the Worker running?"* — which needs none — and any anonymous caller could multiply that at will against a quota shared with the management API. The health check could help cause the outage it exists to detect. The same response also handed out raw D1 error text, which is where SQLite echoes table, column and database names.

Done:

- **`?health=1` is liveness and does no I/O at all.** Binding presence is a synchronous property of `env`, so the answer needs no database: a hundred polls now perform zero queries. 503 with `missingRequired: [...]` when a required binding is absent (binding names are already in the committed `wrangler.toml`; error messages are the sensitive part).
- **`?health=1&deep=1` (or `?health=ready`) is readiness.** It probes every D1 binding and KV — now **in parallel**, so the latency is one round-trip instead of the sum of six — and the result is **cached at the edge for 60 s**, with the per-IP limiter applied on its own bucket. Ten probes in a row cost one set of round-trips. The cache is the edge, not KV, deliberately: a 60 s KV throttle would cost up to 1,440 writes/day against the ~1,000/day budget this file already treats as scarce.
- **Dependency states are public; database internals are not.** An anonymous caller sees `state: ok | missing | error` plus what a degraded feature costs; the actual messages are withheld and written to `error_log`. Full detail is released only to a caller presenting `HEALTH_TOKEN` (`X-Health-Token`, or `?token=` for monitors that cannot set headers), compared in constant time. **An unset `HEALTH_TOKEN` does not mean "open to everyone"** — nobody gets the detail.
- A failing *optional* dependency stays `200` + `degraded: true` (it must not page anyone at 2 a.m.); only a required one is `503`.
- `?action=x&health=1` is a request for `x` again, not a health probe.
- Operator docs: `docs/POST_AUDIT_MANUAL_STEPS.md` B3 now says which URL to monitor and how to get detail; `wrangler.toml` documents `HEALTH_TOKEN` as a secret to set (no value committed).

New `Public/backend/test/health-liveness-and-readiness.test.mjs` (15 tests) — **14 of them fail on `main`**, including "a hundred liveness polls do no I/O" (600+ D1 queries before, 0 now), "repeated deep probes reuse one 60 s result", and "an anonymous caller never sees the D1 error text" (the test seeds `no such column: users.password_hash in database chhath-core` and asserts it appears in the *log* and not in the response).

Verification: `Public/backend` `npm test` **34/34** · `node --check` on every Worker file.

Left for later (same wave): the popup payload is still cached `immutable` per data version, so a *scheduled* popup can be served outside its window — PR-20 next. Single-flight for a concurrent cache miss is PR-24.

## 4. Carry-overs (deliberate, not forgotten)

| # | Item | Why deferred | Where it lands |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Session token still in Web Storage (both frontends) | Cookie-only auth is a rollout with a back-compat window, not a one-file change | Own PR after W1; groundwork already in #318/#319 |
| C2 | Retained React app: no auth-expiry handling, no tests | No test harness there; it is the rollback target, so changes need their own verification | PR-47 (retained-app hardening) |
| C3 | Donation settings not truly atomic | Needs a single backend settings action | Folded into W2 backend work |
| C4 | Collection DOCX still rendered client-side | Server-side rendering is a feature change, not a fix | Post-W3 |
| C5 | `H-6 … WITHOUT decoding` test flake (asserts `ms < 250`) | Pre-existing; timing-based, passes in isolation, fails under full-suite load | PR-46 (CI gates) |
| C6 | Migration CI only scans `mgmt/db/migration/2026-09-05/` | Older folders have uncovered files; widening it fails today | PR-46 |
| C7 | 160 `svelte-check` warnings in the mgmt SPA | Mostly label association — belongs with the a11y work, then fail-on-warning | PR-40 / PR-46 |
| C8 | Public backend has no lockfile; tests started in PR-18 cover the cache/method contract only | Full action coverage needs a Miniflare/workerd harness | PR-25 |
| C9 | `verifyToken` revocation check still fails open on an audit-DB error | Availability trade-off; KV deletion (#319) is now the authoritative revocation | Revisit with W4 observability |
| C10 | React mgmt main chunk at 218.3 kB vs 230 kB CI budget | Little headroom left; not a regression | PR-46 bundle budgets |
| C11 | Consent photos/signatures already archived to Drive by earlier runs are still anonymously readable | Code no longer publishes them (#325), but existing files need a one-off ACL remediation | Operational step: dry-run report → apply, before the next archive |
