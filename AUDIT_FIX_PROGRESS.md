| PR | Title | Audit ID | What it fixed | Deliberately left (tracked in §4) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [#311](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/311) | docs: audit report, fix approach and multi-PR plan | — | Three documents: full audit, batch approach, 48-PR delivery plan | — |
| [#312](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/312) | warn that Full Backup does not cover every table | P0-07 (partial) | Both Backup screens + runbook now name the 12 uncovered tables and point to the CLI export | Real fix = generated manifest (PR-15) |
| [#313](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/313) | commit loan, guarantors and all four consents in one batch | **P0-01 (Critical)** | All 8 rows in one `batch()`; consent rows minted before any write; delivery moved after commit; config checked pre-transaction | — |
| [#314](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/314) | enforce the yearly loan budget atomically | P0-02 | Guarded `INSERT … WHERE (SELECT SUM(amount) …) + ? <= surplus`; dependent rows guarded on the loan existing; race loser gets a real error | Cross-DB `surplus` half still non-transactional (documented; not the race found) |
| [#315](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/315) | validate before rotating consents; conditional loan updates | MGMT-BE-01 | Resend validates template/number **before** burning a token/send; guarantor swap is one batch; disburse is conditional on `Approved` | — |
| [#316](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/316) | claim collection jobs with a verifiable exact-state claim | P0-04 | Claim repeats exact eligibility + `attempts < MAX`; unique `<iso>#<uuid>` token in `claimed_at`, re-read before running | — |
| [#317](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/317) | derive collection jobs from the stored row | P0-03 | `rowIndex` mandatory; year/record-id/payload derived from the committed row; one live job per (row, document) | DOCX bytes are still client-filled — server-side generation is a separate change |
| [#318](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/318) | revoke the effective session token on cookie-only logout | P0-05 | `effectiveSessionToken()`; logout revokes what the request authenticated with; `doLogout('')` no longer fakes success | — |
| [#319](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/319) | end revoked sessions in KV, not just the audit row | P0-09 / C2 | All three revoke paths delete `session:<hash>`; 2FA disable / backup-code regeneration / recovery revoke sessions | Fail-open audit check kept as a *secondary* line (availability) — KV delete is now authoritative |
| [#320](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/320) | scope and purge the view cache per account | P0-08 | Deferred hydration behind `setCacheIdentity(name\|role)`; `purgeCache()` on sign-out; sensitive views never written to disk (both frontends) | Bearer token still in Web Storage → cookie-only auth (§4) |
| [#321](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/321) | return to Login when the session expires | P0-11 | `onAuthExpired` channel (server *and* local expiry, once per expiry); session store clears itself; `resolveAllowedTab()` for initial hash | React rollback app not covered (§4) |
| [#323](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/323) | validate money, year and server-owned columns on every write | P0-09 (backend half) | `assertMoney` / `assertYear` / `assertNoServerOwnedFields`; year mandatory on financial rows; edits can no longer rewrite `Sl. No.` / `created_by` | UI half = #324 |
| [#324](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/324) | validate money and payment details before saving | P0-09 (UI half) | `lib/money.ts` mirrors the backend limits, applied in Home/Expenses/Loans (add + edit); loan year switch no longer keeps the previous year's contributors; donation details validated before any write | Field-level inline errors (still `alert()`) → PR-40; donation publish still setting-by-setting (C3) |
| [#325](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/325) | keep consent evidence private and update the DB before deleting R2 | P0-06 | Archive order is upload → conditional update → verify → delete; consent photos/signatures archived private while PDFs stay public; stale archive cannot overwrite a re-generated file | Consent copies already published by earlier archive runs need a one-off ACL pass (C11) |
| [#326](https://github.com/ashutoshroli/chhath-full-codebase/pull/326) | back up every table and restore an empty table faithfully | P0-07 | All 9 bindings + every schema table (12 were missing, incl. all of `DB_AUDIT`); a schema-vs-map test fails on drift either way; manifest v2 records `{rows, present}`; a present-and-empty table is now cleared on restore while v1 files keep the lenient skip | R2/Drive object backup stays an operational step (the file stores links); `collection_jobs.filled_base64` excluded on purpose |

<sub>#322 was closed as superseded by #323: GitGuardian flagged an *intermediate* commit (an enumerated list of credential column names), and such findings stay attached to a PR's whole history — the branch was recreated from `main` as one clean commit.</sub>

## 2. This PR — the public portal stops calling genuine records invalid

**Audit ID:** P0-10.

Done:

- The Verify screen's two-way verdict is replaced by seven explicit states, decided in a new pure module `src/lib/api/verifyVerdict.ts`: `checking` · `no-id` · `malformed` · `unavailable` · `verified` · `inconclusive` · `not-found`.
- **`not-found` (the red verdict) is now asserted only against live records.** With no data at all the screen says **"Verification Unavailable"** and states plainly that this does not mean the document is invalid; with only a stale snapshot it says **"Could Not Confirm"**. Both offer a **Retry** that refreshes the portal data.
- A hit inside a stale snapshot still reads **verified** — a hit is a real hit — with a note saying it was checked against the saved copy.
- `status: 'idle'` (the prerendered shell, before the client load starts) now counts as *checking*; previously it fell through to the red verdict with an empty payload.
- New i18n keys in **both** languages; the amber heading uses `amber-700` in light mode because the `warning` token is ~2.2:1 on white at this size.
- Removed a dead always-false `failed` expression in `stores/portal.ts`.
- New `src/lib/api/verifyVerdict.test.ts` (15 tests) including an exhaustive walk of all 16 `status` × `failed` × `stale` combinations asserting the authoritative negative appears only when the data is trustworthy.

Verification: `Public/frontend-v6` `npm test` 61/61 · `npm run check` **0 errors, 0 warnings** · build pass.

Left for later: the freshness *provenance* problem behind the stale flag itself (a Workbox cache hit can look like fresh network data) is PR-17, next.

## 4. Carry-overs (deliberate, not forgotten)

| # | Item | Why deferred | Where it lands |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Session token still in Web Storage (both frontends) | Cookie-only auth is a rollout with a back-compat window, not a one-file change | Own PR after W1; groundwork already in #318/#319 |
| C2 | Retained React app: no auth-expiry handling, no tests | No test harness there; it is the rollback target, so changes need their own verification | PR-47 (retained-app hardening) |
| C3 | Donation settings not truly atomic | Needs a single backend settings action | Folded into W2 backend work |
| C4 | Collection DOCX still rendered client-side | Server-side rendering is a feature change, not a fix | Post-W3 |
| C5 | `H-6 … WITHOUT decoding` test flake (asserts `ms < 250`) | Pre-existing; timing-based, passes in isolation, fails under full-suite load | PR-46 (CI gates) |
| C6 | Migration CI only scans `mgmt/db/migration/2026-09-05/` | Older folders have uncovered files; widening it fails today | PR-46 |
| C7 | 160 `svelte-check` warnings in the mgmt SPA | Mostly label association — belongs with the a11y work, then fail-on-warning | PR-40 / PR-46 |
| C8 | Public backend has no lockfile or tests | Needs a Miniflare/workerd harness | PR-25 |
| C9 | `verifyToken` revocation check still fails open on an audit-DB error | Availability trade-off; KV deletion (#319) is now the authoritative revocation | Revisit with W4 observability |
| C10 | React mgmt main chunk at 218.3 kB vs 230 kB CI budget | Little headroom left; not a regression | PR-46 bundle budgets |
| C11 | Consent photos/signatures already archived to Drive by earlier runs are still anonymously readable | Code no longer publishes them (#325), but existing files need a one-off ACL remediation | Operational step: dry-run report → apply, before the next archive |
